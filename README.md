# Full-Stack-Automation-Python-Project
This is my own project that summarizes all the skills I gained after completing the 'Full Stack Automation Python' course at AtidAutomation.

Project Overview:

This project showcases a full-stack automation testing suite, combining a range of platforms, tools, and frameworks that together reflect the skills I acquired from the "Full Stack Automation Python" course at AtidAutomation. The project spans across web, mobile, electron applications and desktop applications, employing various automation and testing techniques to ensure comprehensive test coverage and quality assurance which i describes below.

The testing types involved in this project, frameworks and tools in within them works in this project:

Web Testing: I chose several sites for performing this type it were: AtidStore and NopCommerce. later the website NopCommerce stopped supporting automation, so I made further launches in Jenkins for atidStore. 
Automation frameworks which were used: Selenium WebDriver for functional testing, Applitools Eyes for visual testing;
Automation tools and developmen: Pycharm, EventListener;
CI: Jenkins;
Additional Components: Leveraged EventListeners for enhanced test logging and Allure Reports for detailed test documentation and easy debugging.

Mobile Testing: I successufully realised my mobile testing skills using NopCommerce application
Automation Frameworks which were used: Appium for functional testing;
Automation tools and development: Appium Studio, used PyCharm for development;
CI: Jenkins;
Additional Components: Allure Reports, EventListeners.

Electron Application Testing: For this type of testing i use ToDoList application
The frameworks which were used: Selenium WebDriver;
Automation tools and developmen: Pycharm, EventListener;
CI: Jenkins;
Additional Components:EventListeners and Allure Reports.

Desktop Application Testing: The Calculator Application was testing using WinAppDriver 
Automation Frameworks which were used:  Appium;
Automation tools and development:PyCharm, inspect;
CI: Jenkins;
Additional Components: Allure Reports, EventListeners.

REST API Testing: The website was used is https://reqres.in/
Automation tools and development: PyCharm, Requests
CI: Jenkins;
Additional Components: Allure Reports, EventListeners.

Database Testing:
Automation tools and development:PyCharm, mysql
CI: Jenkins;
